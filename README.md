# Dynamics
Simulation of dynamic systems using numerical methods, the results are visualised by animation and other forms of graphical representation.

## Simple Pendulum
This is a simulation of a pendulum using ordinary differenctial equation derived from the Lagrangian mechanics.<br/>
The motion of the pendulum can be descibed using a 2nd order differential equation:<br/>
